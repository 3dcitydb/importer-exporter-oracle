importer-exporter-oracle
========================

**OUTDATED:** This repository is only meant for creating bugfixes for the previous version 1.6 of the Importer/Exporter for Oracle (to be used with the previous version 2.1 of the 3D City Database). If you want to follow the latest development of the Importer/Exporter, then use this repository instead: https://github.com/3dcitydb/importer-exporter
